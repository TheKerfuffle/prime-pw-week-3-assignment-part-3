      <h2>Check the console...</h2>
    </header>
    <!-- create an ordered list with any questions you have on this week's material -->
<h3>Questions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 - When I FIRST open the index.html file in chrome, the arrays list as >Array (6). Then when the page is refreshed it lists as the array and lists all of the elements of the array. Why is this? Is there something that I am doing wrong here or is that just a quirk of the console element of chrome?</li>
  <li>2 - I didn't really end up having many questions this assignment.</li>
  <li>3 - I mostly feel that my mistakes up to this point haven't been born out of a misunderstanding of the code.</li>
  <li>4 - I mean 246 is obviously less than 250. But I think torturing myself over that mistake is going to be the theme of Prime for me.</li>
  <li>5 - For the next few weeks at the very least...</li>
</ul>
