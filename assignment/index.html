<h3>Questions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 - I didn't really end up having many questions this assignment.</li>
  <li>2 - I mostly feel that my mistakes up to this point haven't been born out of a misunderstanding of the code.</li>
  <li>3 - I mean 246 is obviously less than 250. But I think torturing myself over that mistake is going to be the theme of Prime for me.</li>
  <li>4 - The few weeks at the very least...</li>
</ul>
